          I've got 30 minutes till the end of valentine's day, and I had promised myself to start this off today itself. So, I couldn't really show off my fabulous front end design skills or epic javascript wizardry on this page(I'm not great anyways). Well, actually I could have set up a express.js project, pulled in some fancy material design or even have made something basic in react.js, but that was not the point. The point is...

          Dammit, I'm deviating from my subject here. 14 minutes left. Well here is the gist of it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a new google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up a github account tied to that google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a blank repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Build a blog.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Done!!! That's so simple isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps I plan on making this a tiny bit better than a simple vanilla html page. Good enough? Well I don't know what you are thinking right now. Honestly, I haven't got a clue on how this is going to turn out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll try to explain more in the second entry. Dammit again.. I didn't even think of how I will present the next entries in this page. For now, this link will have to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://nevol.net">Link to second page(if there is any)</a>
        </p>

           [<b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;This page in it's original state was the first public accessible form of nerdsEyeViewOfLife. It was created on 14th February 2017 and is one of two planned clues.]
